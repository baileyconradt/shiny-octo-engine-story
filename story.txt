There once was a man named Marc Renault.
He was a nice man, but he supported the New England Patriots.
Marc taught at UW Madison, specifically computer science.
He always taught the intro course, CS 200 in the Noland Zoology building.
The building was nice, but it always smelled weird.

Hello, p2 is crazy.

Said the man that walked by. Marc wondered if he knew him but was unsure. 
Marc Renaultis Canadian. as like most Canadian he likes hockey.
It also seems that he likes computer programming as well.

Some of Marc's past students came to him to ask him questions about their p2.
Marc answered some of their questions, but didn't tell them everything they needed to know.
When the students asked him why he wouldn't tell them, he told them, "All of you need to 
implement these trees by yourselves to really understand what you are doing-eh.". After 
hearing that all the students were at peace.
