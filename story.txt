There once was a man named Marc Renault.
He was a nice man, but he supported the New England Patriots.
Marc taught at UW Madison, specifically computer science.
He always taught the intro course, CS 200 in the Noland Zoology building.
The building was nice, but it always smelled weird.

Hello, p2 is crazy. 

Said the man that walked by. Marc wondered if he knew him but was unsure. Marc Renaultis Canadian. as like most Canadian he likes hockey. It also seems that he likes computer programming as well.
